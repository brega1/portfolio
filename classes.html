      <h2>CprE 288</h2>
      <p>
        Computer Engineering 288 is the first embedded systems course I took at Iowa State. While I had already been
        familiar with
        embedded systems for a couple years at that point, Iowa State offered an interesting project and an organized
        cirriculum.
        Accessible iRobot Roombas were fitted for students to flash embedded software. Students became familiar with
        concepts like
        registers, peripherals, interrupts, and microcontroller datasheets in this class. I fell in love with this class
        and poured hours
        into the final project.

      <h2>CprE 381</h2>
      <p>
        <i>Computer Engineering 381 involves developing hardware to run our own assembly software. This follows up on
          CprE 281, which involvees basic digital logic. In this class I, along with a partner, developed an ALU,
          control block, and eventually a single-cycle processor in VHDL. We were able to run our own MIPS assembly code
          on our processor. Further projects involved creating a hardware pipeline to make our processors more
          efficient. While this class was an immense amount of work, perhaps more than any other class, I enjoyed every
          bit of it.</i>

      <h2>ComS 309</h2>
      <p>
        This class aimed to address the full stack of software development while practicing group coding workflow with
        Git-- hosted on GitLab. This was my first taste of working on software in a large group setting. Dividing work,
        reviewing code, merging branches, and resolving confilcts continously occured while we were developing a mobile
        web application. This was also my first time working with software pipelines. These experiences helped my lunge
        forward in my internship which used an extremely similar enviroment.

      <h2>ComS 327</h2>
      <p>
        This was a large project based class in C++. I had learned a bit of C++ overtime, but after working with it in
        my internship, I decided I should learn more about it in a class. We developed a game over time, which was great
        since an interesting project was much easier to stick with as things got difficult. C++ is largely seen as one
        of the more difficult languages out there with its messy semantics and unmanaged memory. I feel comfortable
        working with such a language and is often my language of choice for large object oriented projects.

      <h2>CprE 308</h2>
      <p>
        This class was a lab focused class on introducing computer engineering students to operating systems. Working
        with system calls, signals, multithreading, semaphores, mutexes, and shared memory shed light on something that
        was largely mysterious for someone like me-- being more experienced with embedded systems without an OS.
        Learning how to multithread was particularly useful and is a technique I've started to use in my own projects as
        well as in other classes (like ComS 327).

      <h2>CprE 488</h2>
      <p>
        This is the only class that I haven't taken on this list, but I am scheduled to take it for my last semester.
        The reason I am mentioning this class is because I beleive that, even as an elective, it is important and will
        be my favorite class. This is an embedded systems class, but one that takes everything I've done and everything
        I love about computer engineering and puts it all together in one series of labs. This, to me, is peak computer
        engineering and the grand finale to my major.
