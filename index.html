      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Bryce Rega and I'm a student st Iowa State University studying Computer Engineering.
        I've always been facsinated by computers and learned to code at a young age. Previous to Iowa State,
        much of my knowledge and experience came from working on my own side projects. At Iowa State, I was able
        to take what I loved about my side projects and bring it to a whole new level. I plan to graduate May 2025.

      <h2>What Have I Worked On?</h2>
      <p>
        A busy class schedule has resulted in many in class projects. I find myself working a bit "extra" on the ones
        that interest me the most. When I'm not working on class projects, I'm usually working on projects for Iowa
        State's solar car club, PrISUm.
        This has been an excellent opprotunity to expand my knowledge and experience in Computer Engineering in a way
        that doesn't fit will in classes. The work I've done there has taught me so much and has left me feeling
        fufilled.

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <h4><i>Career Objective</i></h4>
      <p>
        I look to work full-time after completing my degree. I've done some work in embedded systems not only for solar
        car, class, and internships. I plan to continue this route. Currently I'm looking to work full time with the
        company I interned with since they've created a position for me that seems very excited. As my career goes on, I
        plan to working at multiple startups-- either as an employee or freelancer. There's something I love about the
        freshness and thrill of a startup. Perhaps I will go on to make my own someday.
