      <h2>PrISUm - Motor Interface Board</h2>
      <p>
        While driving their 15th car, Eliana, team PrISUm found themselves without working electronic motor controllers.
        The motor controllers they had used to supply the correct amount of current/voltage to the motors driving the
        solar-powered
        car were fried. Not only did they lose beneficial features for telemetry and cruise control, but they lost motor
        control altogether.
        To fix this issue, different motor controllers were used. The problem was that they were nowhere near compatible
        for the current
        communication systems on the car, and they lacked features like cruise control. A new board, Motor Interface
        Board, was designed
        and assembled to solve this issue. It acted as a translator as well as a substitue for the brains of the
        additional features.
        It was my task to build and test custom developed software for this board so that the car may be operable again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was selected to work on this project since I had gotten myself familiar with both embedded C software and the
        standards
        our software team had. I would need to explore not just the commonly used features of our microcontrollers, but
        also the more
        unique features that come with the SAMC21J series of chips. In order to get a better understanding of what I
        needed to do on a
        more technical level, I worked with the board's designer to determine which parts of the board did what and how
        I'd be able to
        use them. Communication and documentation played an important role in this project because of this and would
        prove to be an important
        experience going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the embedded systems skills and communication skills, I would need to work on something less
        common in our embedded
        work on the solar car: feedback loop algorithms. Essentially, I needed to develop a custom cruise control for
        the car from scratch.
        I had some previous knowledge on systems going into this project, but to reslly make sure I had everything I
        needed, I used an
        excellent resource already provided by the university, a professor's guidance. I worked with a controls
        professor to finalize my design.
        I would then have this cruise algorithm tested with the rest of the board's software while the car was driving.
        This was a major success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working on this project helped solidify my understanding of techical embedded software topics, give me
        experience working with
        other engineer's design to make something on a larger scale, and document my processes effectively. I would go
        on to give this project
        as an example for an interview for an internship. I ended getting that internship where the lessons I learned
        from this project played
        an important role in the work I did for the internship.
