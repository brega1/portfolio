      <h2>PrISUm - Motor Interface Board</h2>
      <p>
        While driving their 15th car, Eliana, team PrISUm found themselves without working electronic motor controllers.
        The motor controllers they had used to supply the correct amount of current/voltage to the motors driving the
        solar-powered
        car were fried. Not only did they lose beneficial features for telemetry and cruise control, but they lost motor
        control altogether.
        To fix this issue, different motor controllers were used. The problem was that they were nowhere near compatible
        for the current
        communication systems on the car, and they lacked features like cruise control. A new board, Motor Interface
        Board, was designed
        and assembled to solve this issue. It acted as a translator as well as a substitue for the brains of the
        additional features.
        It was my task to build and test custom developed software for this board so that the car may be operable again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was selected to work on this project since I had gotten myself familiar with both embedded C software and the
        standards
        our software team had. I would need to explore not just the commonly used features of our microcontrollers, but
        also the more
        unique features that come with the SAMC21J series of chips. In order to get a better understanding of what I
        needed to do on a
        more technical level, I worked with the board's designer to determine which parts of the board did what and how
        I'd be able to
        use them. Communication and documentation played an important role in this project because of this and would
        prove to be an important
        experience going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the embedded systems skills and communication skills, I would need to work on something less
        common in our embedded
        work on the solar car: feedback loop algorithms. Essentially, I needed to develop a custom cruise control for
        the car from scratch.
        I had some previous knowledge on systems going into this project, but to reslly make sure I had everything I
        needed, I used an
        excellent resource already provided by the university, a professor's guidance. I worked with a controls
        professor to finalize my design.
        I would then have this cruise algorithm tested with the rest of the board's software while the car was driving.
        This was a major success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working on this project helped solidify my understanding of techical embedded software topics, give me
        experience working with
        other engineer's design to make something on a larger scale, and document my processes effectively. I would go
        on to give this project
        as an example for an interview for an internship. I ended getting that internship where the lessons I learned
        from this project played
        an important role in the work I did for the internship.

      <h2>PrISUm - Software Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        As I became a leader in PrISUm, almost all of the board-specific projects were delegated to members of the
        software team rather than myself. Instead, I spent time focusing on big-picture systems and how the software
        integrates into the rest of the car and our team's operations. On our team, we have the embedded software that
        goes on each PCB and is what I manage. We also have our Telemerty system which involves a C++ backend server in
        the car that listens to the embedded software on the boards and reports information to a web application via
        websockets. Finally, our strategy team has Python scripts that can simulate the car digitally, such as the
        battery pack's performace for construction or the car's performace during a race, to give strategy members the
        information they need to make decisions for how we construct and compete with the car.
      </p>
      <p>
        In constructing a new car with new embedded software, new telemetry, and modified strategy software, I saw an
        opprotunity. If we develop all of these systems in house, then they should all be able to talk to eachother and
        aid eachother and can therefore make a smarter car. There could be a software ecosystem that allows the strategy
        software to inform the driver and car's systems on strategic moves and then can use Telemetry to gain data in
        real time to update strategy models in real time. This is an idea that has not been seen in a solar car race
        before, but isn't all that removed from other ecosystems that can be found in industry. For example, the
        military has a software ecosystem that allows a tank to communicate with an aircraft with how to target an
        unseen location and can relay this to a central command.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make this happen, configurations that can be set remotely on the car or locally are stored on the telemetry
        system and local EEPROM emulation on the respective board. Data is sent over CAN within the car and relayed to
        the telemetry system. The Python scripts and the web application would both support the websockets the telemetry
        system uses. This will now be a two way system where the web application can send messages to the driver and the
        strategy software can send recommendations for configurations for each embedded project on the car.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is still being developled, but as phases occur and the project gets further along, the car will
        become smarter and smarter until it is enough to make the difference-- one that makes us go from being a
        competitive solar car team to a dominant solar car team. My role in coordinating this involves learning and
        understanding websocket topics from my previous classes as well as new topics like EEPROM emulation from out
        MCU's datasheet all help move this forward.

      <h2>PrISUm Software Manager</h2>
      <p>
        Becoming the embedded software manager for the solar car team has been one of the best expereinces I've had at
        Iowa State. I haven't lead a team this big with this short of deadlines outside of basic class projects. Each
        semester it was my job to recruit and teach new students about the embedded software they would learn. CprE
        students don't take an embedded class (CprE 288) until their fourth semester and since we have students from
        many majors, some won't take the class at all. Students typically come in with some programming experience with
        little C or embedded knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teaching people about embedded systems so early sets them up for success in class and in fnding an internship.
        My goal is to get people past the initial learning phase and into working on projects. Working on projects that
        actually go on a car can be the best method of learning. Coordinating these projects to make on large embedded
        system work together ias another part of the job and has been a great experience. Seeing everything come
        together and interface with our own hardware as well as third party hardware is satisfying.
