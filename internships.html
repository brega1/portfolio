      <h2>Banner Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        For the summer of 2023, I was accepted for an internsip at Banner Engineering in Plymouth, MN. This was fairly
        close to home and the company seemed to be doing a lot of the embedded work that I'd like. I was right to think
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this summer, I was finally able to see my first professional code base. Similar to what I learned in ComS
        309, Banner used GitLab, pipelines, unit and integration tests, and a very modular design to develop their code.
        I got to work on adding features to existing sensor products and use a similar problem solving process as I
        always do
        when approaching an embedded problem. These changes have made it to production.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other side of development, I got to work on more of a "research" project. Banner had been looking into an
        accessory to a sensor that would involve serial communication, button inputs, and a small LCD screen over SPI.
        Since this was a "research" project, it didn't use the main professional code base. It was up to me to use my
        experience from classes like CprE 288 as well as the two years of solar car experience I had with firmware to
        develop every step. I still, of course, needed to provide plenty of documentation.

      <h2>Continuing Banner Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        I received a return offer for the summer of 2024. This time, I'd be working with a different department. This
        department worked on sensors that had wireless radio connections supported. It was a smaller department that
        aimed to move quicker than others and therefore didn't have as built up of a code base. The code was more
        lightweight which made it easier for me to understand what was going on and far easier to troubleshoot. This
        time I got to work on a sensor that needed a full re-write. This sensor, being connected to a battery powered
        radio, needed to use very little power. I spent time analyzing and testing circuits with my code running to
        measure and decrease power consumption. In solar car, I got a small glimpse at sleep operations for
        microcontrollers, but nothing to this extent. These power saving techniques were new for me and something I had
        wanted to work on. I completed this project and it is currently working its way through the release process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't have a ton of time for another project, so I picked up a project from someone else. There was a sensor
        that wraps around a high power cable and uses the magnetic field generated to measure how much current is
        flowing through. The tricky part is that all I'm given is some small voltage that I need to apply a lot of math
        to in order to figure out how that voltage generated from the field corresponds to current through the cable. I
        worked with other electrical engineers on this and configured an ADC, similar to how I would in solar car or
        CprE 288, to measure and then calculate amperage.

      <h2>Future with Banner Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        At the end of my last intership, I had a meeting with upper management at Banner Engineering where I received an
        offer letter to work full time after graduation. They plan on moving me to yet another department. This time,
        they want me in an inventive role. A role where I can quickly be thrown a new project with priority with the
        goal of trying to turn an idea into a potential product. This rough, fast-paced enviroment is not for everyone.
        They made it very clear that it was not a normal job and that some people don't like that kind of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I mentioned in my goals for my career that I wanted to work for startups with the hopes of a fast-paced,
        inventive enviroment and so that I could learn about what running a startup was like. While Banner Engineering
        is not a startup, this new position is very fast-paced and inventive like a startup would be. This is exactly
        the work I have been looking for. With the experience I had from college and my skills that I learned and used
        at work, I was able to show that I'm capable of holding such a position. I'm excited to see where my career will
        go with this after graduation.
