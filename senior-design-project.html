      <h2> The Motor Controller Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Electric vehicles of all kinds need their own set of special parts. The demand for electric vehicles has
        gone from the occasional golf carts to high demand EVs and electric bikes. With that, these special parts
        are
        needed in high quantity and variety. One notable part, the motor controller, is something that tends to be
        expensive and can be difficult to configure. However, every electric vehicle needs one and all sorts of
        people need to be able to configure it for their project. While there are low power motor controllers for
        drones
        and high power ones for EVs like Teslas, lightweight vehicles like university solar cars and DIY electric
        bikes
        have a lack of options. This lack of options leaves us with motor controllers that are too expensive,
        difficult or unable to configure, and are poorly documented.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of this project is to develop a motor controller for lightweight EVs (such as PRISUM's solar car at
        Iowa State or a DIY ebike) that is less expensive, easily configurable, and can be troubleshooted with
        excellent documentation and tools.

      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>
        Most of my team is hardware oriented, but I will be focues on the embedded systems as that is what I do best.
        This involves using a microcontroller to control 6 PWM channels to time the magnets/phases of the motor. There
        needs to also be software to detect speed with and without HALL sensors, and will also include a PID controller
        to maintain a speed. It should be controlled by both CAN as well as non-CAN methods (GPIO and analog signals).
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, this can be done with a development board. ST has a good example board for our power requirements and
        has a lot of software examples. This software is fairly bloated and can be reverse engineered. Eventually, a
        custom PCB will be developed by the hardware members of the team and we can choose the MCU and ICs that are
        needed. Using our own custom software, we can control these and make this controller work to how we are desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning how a 6-step 3-phase brushless DC motor works in the first place has been extremely challenging and is
        totally new knowledge. I'm familiar with PWM output, but using them in this way (where there are three pairs
        that are controlled the way they are) is something new. Trying to reverse engineer example software as large as
        this has also been challenging. All of these gained skills and experiences is exactly what I was hoping to get
        out of senior design.
