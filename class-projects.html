      <h2>CprE 288 - Intelligent Mapping Roomba</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the embedded systems class, I had developed a modular library that reliably controlled the Roomba.
        Using this modularity, basic telemetry data could be collected and transmitted (initially to a console and then
        to a GUI) and movement algorithms to reach a target while avoiding obstacles. With this completed ahead of time,
        the project's goal could be ambitious: Control a Roomba with a DualShock4 controller using nothing more than a
        GUI sent by the telemetry on the bot while also making use of autonomous algorithms. The Roomba in real time
        would send data to update a live map for the pilot using the controller. The controller moved the Roomba in the
        way a video game would move a character. The pilot could use the right joystick of the controller as well to
        move a target on the map for the Roomba to autonomously drive to.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was an absolute joy. My involvement was heavy as I had experience with this sort of thing whereas
        my group wasn't. When dividing the work, we decided it'd be best for me to focus on C-related embedded work (the
        roomba itself, music, and algorithms) and the rest of the team, more experience with Raspberry Pis, would be
        focused on the Pi to get the DS4 controllers to work. I developed what I needed to and also developed a Python
        GUI on my computer that could display telemetry, show a map of where the roomba is compared to obstacles and
        borders, would show a target for the sutonomous program, and could even control the roomba.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hadn't been too familiar with Python or C websockets, but I learned a lot gettgin those functions to work for
        this project. There were some websocket tutorials online along with TKinter projects that helped guide me along
        the way. Datasheets of the IMU helped me develop I2C support on the roomba to figure out exactly where it was
        using the IMU.

      <h2>ComS 309 - Chinese Checkers</h2>
      <p>
        This was a full-stack development project where a group of 4 students would develop an Android application that
        talked with a webserver to allow for multiple users of different roles to access the app at once. What the app
        did was up to us. To keep things interesting, knowing this could get difficult and long, we decided to choose a
        game that could be done in a turn-based system to prevent a laggy feel. Chinese Checkers was unique and perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        I partnered up with another CprE student to work the backend while the two SE students on our team worked on the
        front end. I was focused on developing tangible features to show during our demonstrations throughout the year.
        This involved developing the system in charge of creating lobbies, freind requests, and parties in the game. I
        had to learn how to develop and interface with a SQL database-- a skill that would prove useful in future
        classes. We learned how to use SpringBoot libraries to keep the backend strucutred and running. Eventually, I'd
        run into using Websockets again to creat in-game and public chats for players to chat in game in real time. A
        lot of SpringBoot tutorials were used to learn how to do all of this properly as much of the class's
        documentation was outdated. We used the Computer Science department's own servers to host our server and
        database and connected it to our GitLab repository's pipeline for executing this project.

      <h2>ComS 319 - Cyclone Eats</h2>
      <p>
        This was a web application project that saw two phases in the class. The first midterm project involved
        setting up a basic website with basic generative tools we had and the second phase had us use ReactJS and a
        database to store information and to do something usefule with it. My partner and I decided on creating a web
        application that combined all of the food options on campus (run by ISU Dining, students, and commercial) into
        one centralized ordering option.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was involved with a lot of the code that interfaced with the database as well as code that helped generate
        webpages. My partner was involved with some page generation and populating our website and database in a way to
        make it useful. In ComS 309, I handled a more structured database, SQL, but in this class, we went for a
        different approach and I learned how to work with MongoDB. While I had some web-dev experience, I never used
        ReactJS tools like WebHooks, JQuery, and parsing JSON to generate pages before. These skills make me confident
        in being able to develop more complicated websites myself-- a useful skill for anyone to have. Our ZyBook was
        fairly sufficient, but other resources like Bootstrap and MongoDB turorials helped point us in the right
        direction. We were able to host the MongoDB database locally and install ReactJS locally to keep things working,
        but these could easily be put on an external server to keep this running.
